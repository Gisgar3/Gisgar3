Hey there 👋 my name is Gavin and I'm a self-taught software developer from Syracuse, New York 🍊

I love to develop software for the open-source community and help others whenever I get the chance! Since June 2019, I've been a member of **[GitHub](https://github.com/github)'s Advisory Council** with the primary goal of improving the platform by conversating with GitHub staff and providing feedback regarding GitHub products and community relations :octocat:

Here are some extra interesting facts about me:
* 🪖 I'm currently an active duty infantryman in the U.S. Army
* 🚗 I am a big car enthusiast! I daily drive a 2008 Chrysler 300C
* 💻 Started coding when I was ten years old! Began with Java, then a few years later I started working with C# development with Microsoft's UWP (when that was new)

Some projects I'm currently working on:
* **[Project PistonSlap](https://github.com/Gisgar3/Project-PistonSlap)**: A ChatGPT-powered assistant that helps troubleshoot and diagnose vehicle problems
* **[Personal Website Overhaul](https://github.com/Gisgar3/Gisgar3.github.io)**: After years of collecting dust, I'm finally getting around to updating my old website! Custom domain, Medium integration, and a full portfolio!
* much more in the future!

I'm now also taking sponsors here on GitHub! Sponsorships help me improve development by allowing me to allocate more resources for projects! If you're interested in sponsoring me, click [here](https://github.com/sponsors/Gisgar3)!
